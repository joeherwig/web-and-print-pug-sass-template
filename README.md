# Web and print pug & sass template
A small template to create HTML documentation which renders responsive for online-use as well as for PDF generation.

## Why?
I simply don't want to care on formatting while writing documentation.
And i want to have it per default responsive web ready without the need of purchasing expensive tools like MS Office etc.
So i decided to create a set of PUG and SASS Files to be able to easily compose documentation "Write books" in VS Code simply with PUG and SASS and render it automatically using the Compile-Hero Plugin in VS Code.
