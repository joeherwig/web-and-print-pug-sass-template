  h1 Foreword 
  p This documentation template is intended to provide an easy base to start with writing documentation that should be published online and as PDF / for printing. 
  p On providing this template and the approach to write the documentation i ensured that easy conversion to EPUBs like with Calibre is ensured by focussing on formatting based on CSS.

  h1 Something about PUG and SASS
  p This ain't going to be a Tutorial regarding PUG and SASS. But you can check it out online for instance @ Youtube: 
  p a way how images can be added to the documentation if you want to have a label as well:
  
  
  h1 Examples of styles 
  
  h2 Image + Label
  .keepTogether
    Label Screenshot "pug icon search"
    img(src="https://i.imgur.com/0Sn048k.png")

  h2 Code example
  p You can also add code and keep it together with a label:
  .keepTogether
    label Just add a block like this for instance for an ini-file
    pre.code 
      |.keepTogether
      |   label program.ini
      |   pre.code
      |     | [general]             
      |     | key=value

  h2 Cite + label
  .keepTogether
    cite PUG is great as you can write very fast based on meta level without caring for design.
